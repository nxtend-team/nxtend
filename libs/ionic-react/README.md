## Background

As a fan of both [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Nx](https://nx.dev/), I found that it would be useful to have schematics that would allow me to leverage the benefits of Nx, Ionic, and React. Over time, I will be adding features and schematics, while trying to stay true to the defaults that both Ionic and Nx provide. This plugin is heavily based on Nx's [`@nrwl/react`](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/tree/master/packages/react) plugin, so I will be keeping the schematics up to date with that as well.

## Install

Install Yarn and the Nx CLI if you have not already:

```
npm install -g yarn @nrwl/cli
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```


## Usage

### Run Unit Tests

```
nx test ionic-react

```
nx e2e ionic-react-e2e
```

### Lint Plugin

```
nx lint ionic-react
```

### Build Plugin

### Link Dependency

To test this plugin locally in a separate project you must link the dependency using NPM or Yarn.

First, navigate to the build output:

```
cd dist/libs/ionic-react
```

If you are going to be linking this dependency to a project that uses NPM:

```
npm link

If you are going to be linking this dependency to a project that uses Yarn:

Then, navigate to the project you want to test.
