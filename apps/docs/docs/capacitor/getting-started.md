The `@nxtend/capacitor` plugin will be added to your workspace and a Capacitor project will be automatically generated with a new `@nxtend/ionic-react` application. However, you can add Capacitor to an existing project.

## Initialize Plugin

First, you need to initialize the `@nxtend/capacitor` plugin:

```
# Angular CLI
ng add @nxtend/capacitor
```

```
# Nx CLI

# npm
npm install --save-dev --exact @nxtend/capacitor

# yarn
yarn add --save-dev --exact @nxtend/capacitor

nx generate @nxtend/capacitor:init
```

## Add Capacitor to Existing Project

Once the plugin has been added to your Nx workspace you can generate a Capacitor project from an existing frontend project:

```
nx generate @nxtend/capacitor:capacitor-project {Capacitor project name} --project {frontend project name}

nx generate @nxtend/capacitor:capacitor-project mobile-app-cap --project mobile-app
```

Nx will ask you some questions about the application, but you can customize it further by passing these options:

```
nx generate @nxtend/capacitor:capacitor-project [name] [options,...]

Options:
  --project               The name of the frontend project for Capacitor.
  --name                  The name of the Capacitor project.
  --directory             A directory where the project is placed
  --appId                 The app ID for the project. (default: io.ionic.starter)
  --appName               The app name for the project.
  --webDir                The directory of your projects built web assets
  --dryRun                Runs through and reports activity without writing to disk.
  --help                  Show available options for project target.
```

## Add Native Platforms

Now that a Capacitor project has been added to your Nx workspace you can begin adding support for native platforms. Currently, Capacitor supports Android and iOS with Electron support being in beta.

```
nx run {Capacitor project name}:add --platform {native platform}

nx run mobile-app-cap:add --platform android
```

## Sync Native Platform

Running the sync command will update the native platform dependencies and copy a build of your frontend project to the Capacitor project:

```
nx run {Capacitor project name}:sync --platform {native platform}

nx run mobile-app-cap:sync --platform android
```

## Open Native Platform

Finally, you can open the native platform:

```
nx run {Capacitor project name}:open --platform {native platform}

nx run mobile-app-cap:open --platform android
```
