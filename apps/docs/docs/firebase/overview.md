[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is a backend for developing applications by Google. Firebase offers solutions for authentication, databases, object storage, and more. This plugin can be used to integrate Firebase into web applications developed in an Nx workspace.

`@nxtend/firebase` will install the latest version of the Firebase dependency, and will configure your application to use `firebase-tools` within your application directory. In true Nx fashion, all commands will go through the Nx CLI. Initializing and deploying an application, and configuring Firebase emulators, has never been easier in Nx.

To learn more about Firebase, visit https://firebase.google.com/docs.

Updates to `@nxtend/firebase` will include migrations that will update the dependencies included with this plugin, as well as any code migrations if possible. For more information on how to properly upgrade this plugin, visit the [upgrades](../nxtend/upgrades) documentation.
