One of my favorite parts of software development is being able to solve the problems that I face. I have been a fan of Firebase for years, but it never felt like it fit in with the Nx tooling. This plugin adds a simple interface with the Nx CLI and `firebase-tools` which removes the need to `cd` into the application directory in order to run commands like `init`, `deploy`, and more. One thing to note is that the `firebase-tools` package must be globally.

Here is an example of running a Firebase command on an application once it has been configured:

```
nx run my-app:firebase --cmd deploy
```

Like I said previously, I built this plugin initially for my own needs, and so I'm not sure what features will come next. If you're a Firebase/Nx user then feel free to reach out to me and let me know what you would like to see out of a plugin like this.
