This release upgrades Capacitor dependencies to 2.4.0, and also makes it easier to add Capacitor plugins to a project. Previously, the user would have to add a Capacitor plugin dependency to both the root workspace `package.json`, but also the individual Capacitor projects `package.json`. Now, a `package.json` in the individual Capacitor project is no longer needed.

## Features

- upgrade Capacitor to 2.4.0
- copy package.json from workspace root for cap commands
