The `@nxtend/capacitor` Nx plugin has finally been released, and an accompanying `@nxtend/ionic-react` update has also been released. The headlining feature for this release is the ability to generate a Capacitor project by default with new Ionic React applications.

## Features

- generate Capacitor project with application by default
- upgrade `@testing-library/jest-dom` to 5.11.0
- upgrade `@testing-library/user-event` to 12.0.11

## Breaking Changes

- `@testing-library/user-event` was upgraded two major versions ([11.0.0](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/releases/tag/v12.0.0)) ([12.0.0](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/releases/tag/v12.0.0))

With this update, developing cross-platform applications in a monorepo architecture has never been easier. I'm incredibly excited to see what users do with this technology, and I can't thank [Nrwl](https://nrwl.io) and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) enough for their work.
