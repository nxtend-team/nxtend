I am excited to announce the release of [nxtend.dev](https://nxtend.dev), the official website for documentation and release notes for nxtend plugins. However, the blog itself is not all that I'm excited about. This site was created with the `@nx-plus/docusaurus` Nx plugin, so not only is the development experience great by being able to store my documentation in the same repo as my plugins, it also proves the potential for community Nx plugins.

I have a lot of changes planned for `@nxtend/ionic-react`, and I have another plugin that is nearing release that will go hand-in-hand with `@nxtend/ionic-react`. To stay tuned to updates, follow this blog, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paranoidcoder), or my [dev.to](https://dev.to/devinshoemaker).
